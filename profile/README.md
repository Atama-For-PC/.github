## 🧠 About This Game

ATAMA is a stealth-horror experience set in a secluded and eerie Japanese village filled with cursed secrets. With no way to fight back, you’ll have to rely on your **wits**, **psychic vision**, and a strong will to survive.

Kaede’s family told tales about her eccentric Aunt Noriko, who lived off the grid in the village of Kisaragi. Letters were rare—until they stopped altogether. Her final note spoke of a “birthright” and “family curse.” Kaede takes the next train to uncover the truth... and walks straight into a nightmare.
